VFW_S_NOPREVIEWPIN                       There was no preview pin available, so the capture pin output is being split to provide both capture and preview.
VFW_S_DVD_NON_ONE_SEQUENTIAL             The current title was not a sequential set of chapters (PGC) and the returned timing information might not be continuous.
VFW_S_DVD_CHANNEL_CONTENTS_NOT_AVAILABLE The audio stream did not contain sufficient information to determine the contents of each channel.
VFW_S_DVD_NOT_ACCURATE                   The seek into the movie was not frame accurate.

DMUS_S_PARTIALLOAD                       The object could only load partially. This can happen if some components are not registered properly, such as embedded tracks and tools. This can also happen if some content is missing. For example, if a segment uses a DLS collection that is not in the loader's current search directory.
DMUS_S_PARTIALDOWNLOAD                   Return value from IDirectMusicBand::Download() which indicates that some of the instruments safely downloaded, but others failed. This usually occurs when some instruments are on PChannels not supported by the performance or port.
DMUS_S_REQUEUE                           Return value from IDirectMusicTool::ProcessPMsg() which indicates to the performance that it should cue the PMsg again automatically.
DMUS_S_FREE                              Return value from IDirectMusicTool::ProcessPMsg() which indicates to the performance that it should free the PMsg automatically.
DMUS_S_END                               Return value from IDirectMusicTrack::Play() which indicates to the segment that the track has no more data after mtEnd.
DMUS_S_STRING_TRUNCATED                  Returned string has been truncated to fit the buffer size.
DMUS_S_LAST_TOOL                         Returned from IDirectMusicGraph::StampPMsg() this indicates that the PMsg is already stamped with the last tool in the graph. The returned PMsg's tool pointer is now NULL.
DMUS_S_OVER_CHORD                        Returned from IDirectMusicPerformance::MusicToMIDI() this indicates  that no note has been calculated because the music value has the note  at a position higher than the top note of the chord. This applies only to DMUS_PLAYMODE_NORMALCHORD play mode. This success code indicates that the caller should not do anything with the note. It is not meant to be played against this chord.
DMUS_S_UP_OCTAVE                         Returned from IDirectMusicPerformance::MIDIToMusic() and IDirectMusicPerformance::MusicToMIDI() this indicates that the note conversion generated a note value that is below 0, so it has been bumped up one or more octaves to be in the proper MIDI range of 0 through 127.  Note that this is valid for MIDIToMusic() when using play modes DMUS_PLAYMODE_FIXEDTOCHORD and DMUS_PLAYMODE_FIXEDTOKEY, both of which store MIDI values in wMusicValue. With MusicToMIDI() it is valid for all play modes. Of course, DMUS_PLAYMODE_FIXED will never return this success code.
DMUS_S_DOWN_OCTAVE                       Returned from IDirectMusicPerformance::MIDIToMusic()  and IDirectMusicPerformance::MusicToMIDI() this indicates  that the note conversion generated a note value that is above 127, so it has been bumped down one or more octaves to be in the proper MIDI range of 0 through 127.  Note that this is valid for MIDIToMusic() when using play modes DMUS_PLAYMODE_FIXEDTOCHORD and DMUS_PLAYMODE_FIXEDTOKEY, both of which store MIDI values in wMusicValue. With MusicToMIDI() it is valid for all play modes. Of course, DMUS_PLAYMODE_FIXED will never return this success code.
DMUS_S_NOBUFFERCONTROL                   Although the audio output from the port will be routed to the same device as the given DirectSound buffer, buffer controls such as pan and volume will not affect the output.
DMUS_S_GARBAGE_COLLECTED                 The requested operation was not performed because during CollectGarbage the loader determined that the object had been released.

DMUS_E_INVALID_TOOL_HDR                  The IStream* object's data contains an invalid tool header (ckid is 0 and fccType is NULL,) and therefore cannot be read by the graph object.
DMUS_E_ALL_TOOLS_FAILED                  The graph object was unable to load all tools from the IStream* object data. This may be due to errors in the stream, or the tools being incorrectly registered on the client.
DMUS_E_ALL_TRACKS_FAILED                 The segment object was unable to load all tracks from the IStream* object data. This may be due to errors in the stream, or the tracks being incorrectly registered on the client.

DMUS_E_ALREADY_SENT                      The DMUS_PMSG has already been sent to the performance object via IDirectMusicPerformance::SendPMsg().
DMUS_E_CANNOT_FREE                       The DMUS_PMSG was either not allocated by the performance via IDirectMusicPerformance::AllocPMsg() or it was already freed via IDirectMusicPerformance::FreePMsg().

DMUS_E_CANNOT_CONVERT                    A call to MIDIToMusic() or MusicToMIDI() resulted in an error because the requested conversion could not happen. This usually occurs when the provided DMUS_CHORD_KEY structure has an invalid chord or scale pattern.
DMUS_E_DESCEND_CHUNK_FAIL                DMUS_E_DESCEND_CHUNK_FAIL is returned when the end of the file  was reached before the desired chunk was found.
DMUS_E_NOT_LOADED                        An attempt to use this object failed because it first needs to be loaded.

DMUS_E_SCRIPT_CANTLOAD_OLEAUT32          Loading of oleaut32.dll failed.  VBScript and other activeX scripting languages require use of oleaut32.dll.  On platforms where oleaut32.dll is not present, only the DirectMusicScript language, which doesn't require oleaut32.dll can be used.
DMUS_E_SCRIPT_LOADSCRIPT_ERROR           An error occurred while parsing a script loaded using LoadScript.  The script that was loaded contains an error.
DMUS_E_SCRIPT_INVALID_FILE               The script file is invalid.
DMUS_E_INVALID_SCRIPTTRACK               The file contains an invalid script track.

DMUS_E_AUDIOVBSCRIPT_RUNTIMEERROR        A script routine written in AudioVBScript failed because an invalid operation occurred.  For example, adding the number 3 to a segment object would produce this error.  So would attempting to call a routine that doesn't exist.
DMUS_E_AUDIOVBSCRIPT_OPERATIONFAILURE    A script routine written in AudioVBScript failed because a function outside of a script failed to complete. For example, a call to PlaySegment that fails to play because of low memory would return this error.
DMUS_E_AUDIOPATHS_NOT_VALID              The Performance has set up some PChannels using the AssignPChannel command, which makes it not capable of supporting audio paths.
DMUS_E_AUDIOPATHS_IN_USE                 This is the inverse of the previous error. The Performance has set up some audio paths, which makes is incompatible with the calls to allocate pchannels, etc. 
DMUS_E_NO_AUDIOPATH_CONFIG               A segment or song was asked for its embedded audio path configuration, but there isn't any. 
DMUS_E_AUDIOPATH_INACTIVE                An audiopath is inactive, perhaps because closedown was called.
DMUS_E_AUDIOPATH_NOBUFFER                An audiopath failed to create because a requested buffer could not be created.
DMUS_E_AUDIOPATH_NOPORT                  An audiopath could not be used for playback because it lacked port assignments.
DMUS_E_NO_AUDIOPATH                      Attempt was made to play segment in audiopath mode and there was no audiopath.
